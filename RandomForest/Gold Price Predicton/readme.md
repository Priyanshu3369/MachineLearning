        <h1>Gold Price Prediction Model</h1>
        <p>This project uses a <span>Random Forest Classifier</span> to predict the future price of gold based on historical data. This model aims to assist investors and analysts in understanding potential gold price trends.</p>
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> Random Forest Classifier</li>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Predict if the gold price will increase or decrease.</li>
            <li><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy</li>
            <li><strong>Error Rate:</strong> 0.98%</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Model Training</h2>
        <p>The Random Forest Classifier was chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships within data. The model was trained with a dataset split into training and testing sets to validate its accuracy.</p>
      <h3>Key Steps:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection</li>
            <li>Training the Model: Using scikit-learn's <span>RandomForestClassifier</span></li>
            <li>Evaluation: R2 Score</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Once trained, the model provides predictions on whether the price of gold is likely to increase or decrease. This prediction can be used to make informed decisions about gold investments.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The model achieves a minimal error rate of 0.98%, ensuring high prediction reliability.</p>
