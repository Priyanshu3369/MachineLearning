  <h1>SUV Price Prediction Model</h1>

  <h2>About The Project</h2>
  <p>This project leverages machine learning to predict the price of SUVs based on various input features. It utilizes a supervised learning algorithm, trained on a dataset of SUV prices, to estimate the price of a vehicle based on specific attributes.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Predicts the price of SUVs based on factors such as mileage, model year, engine size, and other relevant attributes.</li>
    <li>Implemented using popular machine learning libraries like <code>scikit-learn</code> and <code>pandas</code>.</li>
  </ul>
