        <h1>Heart Disease Prediction Model</h1>
        <p>
            This project features a Machine Learning model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in an individual. 
            By analyzing relevant health metrics, the model provides a probability score that indicates the risk of heart disease.
            Leveraging medical data and advanced algorithms, this tool can aid in identifying individuals at risk and contribute to 
            preventive healthcare strategies.
