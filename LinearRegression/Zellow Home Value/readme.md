# 🏠 Zillow House Value Prediction

## 📊 Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the value of yellow houses based on various features such as location, size, age, and amenities. The goal is to demonstrate data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains features like:
- **Location Coordinates**: Geographic information.
- **Size**: Square footage of the house.
- **Age of the House**: Years since the house was built.
- **Amenities**: Information regarding features like swimming pools, garages, etc.
- **Sale Value**: The target variable representing the house's market value.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
The following tools and libraries were used:
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: Data wrangling and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model development.
- **XGBoost**: Gradient Boosted Tree implementation for predictive analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Exploration and experimentation environment.

## ⚙️ Features
Key features implemented in this project:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Scaled numerical features, encoded categorical features as necessary.
3. **Model Implementation**: Compared Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Reported training/validation errors to compare model performances.
