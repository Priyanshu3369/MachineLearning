# Boston House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to predict the price of houses in Boston using machine learning algorithms. It leverages various techniques, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, to predict housing prices based on features such as the number of rooms, crime rate, property age, and more.

The model achieves an accuracy of **85%**, making it a reliable tool for predicting housing prices.

## Features

- Predict house prices in Boston using multiple machine learning algorithms.
- Comparison of different models to find the best predictor.
- Visualization of model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-Squared.
- The model achieves an **85% accuracy** on the test set.
